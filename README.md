# Group Repository for COMP SCI 2207/7207 Web & Database Computing Web Application Project (2025 Semester 1)

## Project Description
MetaPlay is a web application that allows users to find, interact with, and follow video games, accessing live data from the RAWG Video Games Database API, and socialise with other gamers. MetaPlayâ€™s target audience consists of gamers, both the casual gamer who plays mobile games and the hardcore PC gamer or professional gamer. MetaPlay will have a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to search through a massive collection of games across various platforms, genres, and popularity rankings. Users will be able to build and manage personalised game collections, keep track of played and wish listed games, and search for details like ratings, release dates, descriptions, screenshots, and player counts. MetaPlay will have search and filtering features to make it easy to find games based on genre, platform, release year, or user ratings. Users will also be able to contribute reviews and ratings, join groups, and make friends, helping to shape a dynamic and community-driven experience.

## Setup instructions

Navigate to the repository Final????, once there install the required dependencies by running npm install express morgan express-session passport dotenv bcrypt mysql2 passport-google-oauth20, the .env is included in the directory and contains the API key, and specific database information. This allows the server to connect to the mysql database and RAWG API correctly. To continue you must import the database schema by using mysql -u root -p metaplay < Schema.sql then ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; mysql -u root -p. once this is ready start the server using npm start, this will allow you to open the webpage using 'open in browser' or http://localhost:8080.
